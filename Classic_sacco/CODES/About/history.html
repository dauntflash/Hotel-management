            <h2><u>WHO WE ARE?</u></h2>
            <p>Classic SACCO was founded in the year 2023 as a community-driven initiative aimed at promoting financial inclusion among its members. The idea behind the SACCO was to provide affordable and accessible financial services to the members, who are mainly from low-income backgrounds.
        
                The SACCO was formed by a group of like-minded individuals who were passionate about helping their community improve their financial well-being. They saw the need for an institution that could provide financial services to people who were excluded from traditional banking institutions due to various reasons such as lack of collateral or a poor credit history.
                
                The SACCO started with a small membership of 50 individuals, who all contributed a minimum share capital to become members. The SACCO's focus was on providing savings and credit services, and within the first year of operation, it had disbursed over Kshs. 1 million in loans to its members.
                
                As the SACCO grew, it expanded its services to include other financial products such as insurance, investment, and mobile banking. It also increased its membership to over 500 members, and it is now looking to expand its services to other regions.
                
                Today, Classic SACCO is a thriving financial institution, committed to helping its members achieve their financial goals and improve their livelihoods.
